### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

The mean is the average (sum divided by the total number of observations) of our observations.

The expected value is the average we expect to get from repeting our experiment a large number of times.



### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?

P-value is defined as the best (largest) probability that a result of a test is more extreme (bigger or lower) than the most extreme test results we already saw

It is generally expected that a study should have a P < 0.05 as way to avoid considering ‘statistically non-significant’ outliers 

The problem is, that threshold can lead scientists to disregard data to keep within the P < 0.05, without considering whether that data is significant or not.


### Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.
